I did not manage to finish the termination part as i couldnt figure our why the program does not end after the last customer has been served.
Other than that the program works fine.

to run this program:

compile -> gcc -o program program.c
run the program -> ./program c_file.txt 100 1 2 2 3 (1,2,2,3 can be any number you like as these are time variables)

Sample output and input are given in the c_file.txt and r_log.txt in the assignment folder

The references i stated in my code are resources that i have used to learn about the things I need to complete this assignment.
